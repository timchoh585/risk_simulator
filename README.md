# risk_simulator
Building a simulator to show the best results for a game of Risk.

Building a comprehensive (holding off on the GUI until the text based version is at least somewhat working) solution to knowing where to move to based on a series of 10000 trials.  Because this is a partially a game of luck, there is no real solution to this, just an estimate of what could happen.

Open source project to have some of my friends help out. Using MIT license, up for use by anyone as long as they keep the license in their release.
